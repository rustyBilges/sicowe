Radiographe xample:
	- tall versus wide data
	- laeblled
	- how much data for unsupervised learning?

Student example: unsupervised clustering
	- based on: citation
	- meniton personalised medicine

My example: image extraction
	- easy to do deep learning (tools are available e.g. TensforFlow)
	- if: good training data (what is good: well labelled, large volume)
	- time is spent in data prepartaion
	- point is: not how do we do this stuff, but what data have we got and what questions can it answer


Causality issue: worth touching on!
	"Algorithms may be good at predict-
	ing outcomes, but predictors are
	not causes. 3" 
	(good medical example of high qulaity predcitions with no idea about causation?)

	- spurious correlations (give funny examples)
	- p-value problem

Machine learning basics to touch on:
	- difference between machine learning and other algorithms (e.g. expert systems)
	- features
	- feautre space
	- black box model (what in the box)
	- supervised versus unsupervised (semi-supervised)
	- deep learning
	- validation and testing
	- missing data (information in missingness) and bias
	- NLP

	- more subtle stuff:
		> algorithms that shit where they eat
		> reinforcing pre-existing biases/divisions 

	- current hot stuff:
		> transfer learning
		> explainability, fairness..?
		> gans
		> noisy labels

Three ways machine learning will impact healthcare:
	- prognosis (and risk) scores
	- replace much work of radiologists and anatomical pathologists
		> interpreting imaing and test results	
		> and real-time wave form data 
	- improve diagnosis (slower)

Is Bablyon health an expert system?
